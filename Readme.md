# Rust Project-Based Learning Application

## Overview

This Rust application serves as a practical introduction to Rust programming, focusing on core concepts such as error handling, I/O operations, and modular code organization. It's designed to provide hands-on experience with Rust's unique features, making it an ideal project for those new to the language or looking to solidify their understanding through applied practice.

## Features

- **Error Handling**: Demonstrates Rust's approach to error handling using the `Result` type and `match` expressions, allowing for clear and concise management of potential errors.
- **I/O Operations**: Introduces basic input/output operations in Rust, showcasing how to interact with the standard output and handle any issues that may arise.
- **Modular Code**: Utilizes Rust's module system to organize code into logical units, promoting better code structure and readability.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install both by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdabir1203/InventRust.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

To run the application, execute:

## Usage
Upon running the application, it attempts to display a greeting to the user. The outcome of this operation is handled gracefully:

On success, it prints "Greeting displayed successfully." to the standard output.
If an error occurs (e.g., an issue with writing to the standard output), it prints an error message to the standard error output, detailing the nature of the failure.
