The Crazy Cure Calculator is a simple, interactive command-line application written in Rust. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two input numbers. This document aims to provide both a technical and user-friendly overview of how the application works.

Features
User Interaction: Prompts users for input through the command line.
Supports Basic Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) on two numbers.
Error Handling: The application gracefully handles invalid inputs by prompting the user to enter a valid number.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Rust programming language setup on your machine. Visit The Rust Programming Language website for installation instructions.
Running the Application
Clone the Repository: First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

Navigate to the Application Directory: Change into the directory containing the application.

Run the Application: Use Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system, to compile and run the application.

Follow the On-Screen Prompts: The application will guide you through entering two numbers and selecting an operation to perform.

How It Works
Technical Details
Reading Input: The application uses Rust's std::io library to read user input from the command line.
Parsing Input: Input numbers are initially read as strings and then parsed into 64-bit floating-point numbers (f64) for arithmetic operations.
Selecting Operations: A match statement is used to determine the operation based on the user's choice, performing the corresponding arithmetic operation on the input numbers.
Error Handling: The application checks for valid numerical input and responds with appropriate error messages if the input is invalid.
User Interaction Flow
Welcome Message: Upon starting, the application displays a welcome message.
Input Numbers: Users are prompted to enter two numbers, one at a time.
Select Operation: Users choose an arithmetic operation to perform on the entered numbers.
Display Result: The application calculates and displays the result of the chosen operation.
Conclusion
The Crazy Cure Calculator is a straightforward yet powerful example of how Rust can be used to create interactive command-line applications. It demonstrates basic programming concepts such as input/output operations, parsing strings to numbers, conditional logic with match statements, and error handling.

For further exploration, users can extend the application to include more complex operations, improve error handling, or enhance the user interface.
